This sample renders 3D models (Wavefront .obj files, at the
moment) with simple diffuse lighting. The PS3's controller can be used
to cycle through the models (using the circle and square buttons),
rotate the model (left stick), and adjust the model's size (right
stick).

The program uses the Open Asset Import Library ("assimp";
http://assimp.sourceforge.net) to load the models. Because that
project's source distribution is rather large, I've decided not to
include it with RSXGL. Therefore you will need to download the
project's source and reconfigure RSXGL's build process to tell it
where assimp is. You do /not/ need to build assimp yourself - RSXGL
includes an autoconf-based build process for assimp (in src/assimp).

The following process clones assimp to the location where RSXGL's
configure script expects to find it, by default:

	  cd ~/rsxgl/extsrc
	  git clone git://github.com/assimp/assimp.git assimp
	  cd ~/rsxgl
	  ./configure
	  make

If you want to clone assimp elsewhere, you can tell configure to find
it there, too:

   	  cd ~/rsxgl
	  ./configure --with-assimp-source=/path/to/assimp
	  make
